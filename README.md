# Sentimentsoldiers
A Capstone Project for Spring 2025 Semester

Process:

Step 1:

Upon selected a proposal to work on We divided up work evenly to find reliable sources for:
- Nuclear Statistic Data
- Sentiment Data on Nuclear Energy 
We completed a literature review on each and compared different articles to become expertise in the subject matter

Step 2:

We scraped for most recent data

Step 3:

We found an initial set of relevant variables/columns in each source that can be added upon in future steps. We each took time to extract our columns. Matthew merged the columns we selected. 

Step 4:

With a functional merged csv...we will now proceed with creating a few simple visualizations with the data we have on hand and see what we can observe
